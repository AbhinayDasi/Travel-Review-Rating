#Travel Review Rating Visualization
Project Overview:
This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize travel review ratings. The goal is to gain insights into the patterns and trends in customer reviews, helping businesses to improve their services.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains travel review ratings from various sources.
The data was preprocessed using NumPy and Pandas to ensure quality and consistency.
Visualization:
Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to generate informative graphs and plots, providing a clear understanding of the review ratings.
The visualizations help identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
Technologies Used:
Python: Primary programming language used for the project.
Machine Learning: Techniques applied to analyze and visualize the review ratings.
NumPy: Library used for numerical computations and data preprocessing.
Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: Library used for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
Project Highlights:
Effective use of machine learning techniques to analyze travel review ratings.
Informative visualizations providing insights into customer reviews.
Demonstration of data preprocessing and analysis skills using NumPy and Pandas.
